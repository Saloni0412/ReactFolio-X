This was created to portrait my portfolio using react through which i can showcase my skills to my future employer. I created this project as it is live and offer a changing environment so i can edit it accordingly. This makes it easier for me to get all my projects on one page. This presents a header with navigation for sections like About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. Visitors can view the short bio, explore six applications with links to deployments and GitHub repositories, and find a contact form. The footer includes links to the profiles on GitHub, LinkedIn, and other platforms, providing easy connections. The design ensures a seamless experience without page reloading when clicking on navigation titles.
